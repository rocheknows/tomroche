      <u>A storyteller’s view of the family archive {2019}</u
      ><br /><br /><br />When formal documentation is void, unobtainable, where
      does one look for clues on their heritage? Family stories; dusty boxes of
      family photographs; speculation? I think it’s all of the above. The story
      of us, the story of our family is not one way of storytelling, rather an
      amalgamation of different methods of; communication, memory, and
      post-memory. The idea of post-memory was coined by Marianne Hirsch in her
      book Family frames (2002), an insight into the reading of the family album
      - with the anxieties and tension that go with it.

      <br /><br />
      <h3>
        <i
          >“Postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory
          precisely because its connection to its object or source is meditated
          not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and
          creation.”</i
        >
      </h3>
      <small>- Marianne Hirsch. 2002.</small><br /><br />

      There will always be subjectivity when thinking about the past. Whom upset
      whom, the uncle we don’t talk about, the rose tint of nostalgia always
      making an appearance. We cannot understand our past unless we understand
      embracing the unknown and speculative thinking. In what way does thinking
      about the past change how you see the present. How do certain stories
      alter the remembrance of the past?<br /><br />If we think in a linear
      pattern, the aging process of the family album becomes devoid of making
      sense. Family member A takes out certain images, curates them into their
      view of the past - While Family member B scratches out their face and
      throws away photographs that unflatter their image. Take Annette Kuhn for
      example. In her Remembrance essay, she writes about the confusion that her
      mother had of a certain image of Kuhn. Her mother remembers one thing,
      while Annette (the subject) of the photograph remembers another. On the
      back of the image a conflict of interest with the caption. Her mother's
      Caption states the date and location that she believes it was, while a
      correction from the subject tells a different story. The conflict on the
      back of an image, altered on more than one occasion. Did this happen over
      years, or at the time of development?<br /><br />I’m not so much
      interested in conflict, rather the beauty of a chaotic story. One with no
      beginning or an end. Just interpretation. Interpretation that can change
      if one key image is removed, or 50 being cataloged in a photo album. The
      context changes, therefore the meaning changes. When there are no facts,
      no concrete evidence, just hearsay, and folklore; the beauty lies in the
      not knowing.<br /><br />
